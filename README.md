# Iga Gruszczyńska - Portfolio

## Description

The project intended to be a showcase of mine and my work. Here you can find my short life timeline and projects that I managed to create during my front-end path.
Portfolio contains some things which I'd like to show by this portfolio besides my bio:
- SCSS (mixins, variables),
- Responsiveness,
- Responsive menu ("Burger"),
- Neumorphism,
- Converting JS code to be compatibile with all browsers.

Feel free to check my portfolio! :cherry_blossom:

## Roadmap

I think the best development for my portfolio will be creating new projects which I could add and show publicly.
